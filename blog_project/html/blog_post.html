              In the summer and the autumn of 1185 once again the Balkans have
              become a stage for the clash of world powers. The Sicilian Normans
              invaded in July and sacked Thessaloica a month later. This to led to
               a chaos in the Byzantine empire resulting in a revolt during which
               the throne was overtaken by Isaac Angelos II. Could one imagine a
               better times for a nation endured the tests of history to rise
               again for a new start.

              The art of becoming a doer but not just a mere actor is hard to
              master. It takes more than pure courage and the goodwill of fate to
              consciously feel that in this very moment you are one with the
              universe and do what you have to. Two brothers Asen and Peter,
              descendants of the once-great Bulgarian empire tzars, are just about
               to enter the room for an audience with Isaac II, the Byzantium
               emperor himself. Some people say that when a great thing is about
               to happen a prepared person with his senses well-tuned and trained
               can feel it. Inside the room, there is the emperor, his uncle
               John Doukas (who is also now his adviser), a translator and funny
               looking chronicler wearing shabby clothes, and several bored and
               emotionless soldiers. The brothers took a deep breath and entered a
                spacious room. Last time when they've been honoured with the
                chance for an audience with the emperor the crown, with its
                magically gleaming sapphires and diamonds, was worn by
                Andronikos I Komnenos. Isaac II overthrew him just months ago.
                Now the two brothers looked and noded at each other, taking a deep
                 breath approached the new emperor, bowed a bit and waited for
                 permission to speak.
